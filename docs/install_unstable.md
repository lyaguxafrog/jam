title: Installing unstable Jam
---

If you need to install a non-stable/dev version of Jam, for example,
to help with testing during the development of a new version,
or if you need functionality that is not yet fully ready/tested right now.

```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/lyaguxafrog/jam.git@unstable
```

!!! Warning
    By installing Jam in this way, you agree that everything can break,
    explode, you can be kidnapped by aliens, everything is at your own risk :D

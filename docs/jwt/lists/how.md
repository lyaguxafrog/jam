# How to use Jam lists?
Jam has 2 modules for managing black and white lists.

* [JSONList](json.md) - is a module for storing tokens locally as json.
* [RedisList](redis.md) - is a module for storing tokens in [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/).

You can also create your own module VERY easily. See [Custom Module](own_module.md).
